#  Object Oriented Ruby Warmups

A series of exercises designed to get your object-oriented muscles working properly.
* ttt_interfaces.md - lists public interfaces in the tic_tac_toe.rb
* tweeter.rb - draft of an application that keeps track of "Tweets" which will later be sent by using the Twitter API.
* deep_dup.rb - returns a completely new object on a 2-or-more dimensional array. Created Array class method. It can be checked in 'pry' or 'irb' as follows:
## Getting Started
```
$ ruby deep_dup.rb
$ pry
[ [ 1, [ 2, 3 ] ], [ 4, 5, 6], [ [ 7, 8, [ 9, 10 ]], [11, 12] ].deep_dup
```

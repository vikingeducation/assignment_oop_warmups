  Go back to the Tic Tac Toe demo and write down the interface for each of the
  classes it uses. This means indicating which methods and variables are
  publicly available and how to call them.


class TicTacToe
  play()

class Player
  name
  name = (new_value)
  piece
  piece = (new_value)
  get_coordinates()

class Board
  board_arr
  render()
